This is a project aiming to demonstrate a simple database with BTree implementation on different platforms.
SerceDB is going to be implemented on Java platform at first but later implementations is on the ToDo list
for C/C++ and GO.

Aim of the Project
------------------
I was searching a detailed tutorial for BTree implementation, that which explains the primitive usage of
BTree in a database software and explains everything that is done under the hood, and I couldn't find :)
The best way to learn a system is to do it from scratch so, this project aims to demonstrate BTree at
first.

Secondly, I want to get experienced on porting the same code on different languages, why? To see the 
performance difference of the same code on Java and C. Main implementation will be written on Java but
second implementation is going to be written on C, then C++ and so on.
