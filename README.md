========
![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/HouseSparrow23.jpg "Sevimli Serce")

This is a project aiming to demonstrate a simple database with **BTree** implementation on different languages.
**SerceDB** is going to be implemented on **Java platform** at first but later implementations is on the **ToDo** list
for **C/C++**, **D** and **GO**.

Aim of the Project
------------------
I was searching a detailed tutorial for **BTree** implementation, that which explains the primitive usage of
**BTree** in a database software and explains everything that is done under the hood, and I couldn't find :)
The best way to learn a system is to do it from scratch so, this project aims to demonstrate **BTree** at
first.

Secondly, I want to get experienced on porting the same code on different languages, why? To see the 
performance difference of the same code on **Java** and **C**. Main implementation will be written on **Java** but
second implementation is going to be written on **C**, then **C++** and so on.
